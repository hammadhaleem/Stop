[ Scientific and Smart, Selling, sharing, shopping on top ]
===================
In simple terms our application is a product sharing and selling service where you can list your
products, buy or even review products. Its a scientific and smart selling, sharing and shopping
platform for everyone.

We have divided the audience into two broad parts that are :

Closed groups : In the closed group approach we plan to enable sharing among
different closed groups like school, universities and offices. With people having a trust on
each other closed group sharing model is quite effective in selling goods. The main
purpose of the closed group model is to share goods rather than selling things.

Open Group : People can list goods in open group, i.e the whole world and anyone can
contact them to purchase goods. The main purpose of such group is to enable sharing
outside the closed group. People can either sell or share goods with others who are
willing to take it.

The main problem the application focuses is on how user can effectively add goods on the
platform. The traditional methods of clicking the picture and writing content appear quite
troublesome and hence people at times tend not to put things over internet for sale.
We plan to implement a method for easily adding items to platform using various technologies
like the OCR(optical character recognition) , The bar code scanning and other object
identification methods.

Apart from having great methods for adding content in the application we plan to incorporate
localised search for finding content near you. This way user can search and plan his journey
finding things. Unlike google maps we plan to incorporate individual sellers and not only focus on
big sellers.
